                It's hard to feel positive when our kids or teenagers are driving us crazy. We often end up saying "Stop
                doing that!" But
                children are much more likely to do what we ask if we give them positive instructions and lots of praise

                they have done well. They may not show it, but
                you'll see them doing that good thing again. It will

                <li>Try to stay calm when giving the consequence.</li>
                <li>Make sure you can follow through with the
                    consequence. For example, taking away a

                    Taking it away for one hour is more realistic.</li>
                <li>Once the consequence is over, give your child
                    a chance to do something good, and praise

                            on the floor, your hands resting in your lap.</li>
                        <li>Close your eyes if you feel comfortable.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Step 2: Think, feel, body
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ask yourself, "What am I thinking now?"
                        </li>
                        <li>Notice your thoughts. Notice if they are negative
                            or positive.
                        </li>
                        <li>Notice how you feel emotionally. Notice if your
                            feelings are happy or not.
                        </li>
                        <li>Notice how your body feels. Notice anything that
                            hurts or is tense.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Step 3: Focus on your breath
                    <ul>
                        <li>Listen to your breath as it goes in and out.
                        </li>
                        <li>You can put a hand on your stomach and feel it
                            rise and fall with each breath.
                        </li>
                        <li>You may want to say to yourself "It's okay.
                            Whatever it is, I am okay."
                        </li>
                        <li>Then just listen to your breath for a while.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Step 4: Coming back
                    <ul>
                        <li>Notice how your whole body feels.
                        </li>
                        <li>Listen to the sounds in the room.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Step 5: Reflecting
                    <ul>
                        <li>Think 'do I feel different at all?'
                        </li>
                        <li>When you are ready, open your eyes</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                Be willing to talk. They will already have heard something. Silence and secrets do not protect our children.
                Honesty and openness do. Think about how much they will understand. You know them best.

            <h2>Be open and listen</h2>
            <p>Allow your child to talk freely. Ask them open questions
                and find out how much they already know.</p>
            <h2>Be honest</h2>
            <p>Always answer their questions truthfully. Think about how
                old your child is and how much they can understand.</p>
            <h2>Be supportive</h2>
            <p>Your child may be scared or confused. Give them space
                to share how they are feeling and let them know you are
                there for them.</p>

            <p>It is fine to say "We don't know,
                but we are working on it; or we
                don't know, but we think." Use
                this as an opportunity to learn
                something new with your child!
            </p>
            <h2>Heroes not bullies</h2>
            <p>Explain that COVID-19 has nothing to do with
                the way someone looks, where they are from, or
                what language they speak. Tell your child that
                we can be compassionate to people who are
                sick and those who are caring for them.
                Look for stories of people who are working to
                stop the outbreak and are caring for sick people.</p>

        <div class="purple-bg">
            <h2>End on a good note</h2>
            <p>Check to see if your child is okay. Remind them
                that you care and that they can they can talk to
                you anytime. Then do something fun together!</p>
