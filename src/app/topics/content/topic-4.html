      All children misbehave. It is normal when children are tired, hungry,
      afraid, or learning independence. And they can drive us crazy when stuck
      at home.

        Catch bad behavior early and redirect your kids' attention from a bad to
        a good behavior.
      </li>
      <li translate>
        Stop it before it starts! When they start to get restless, you can
        distract with something interesting or fun: "Come, let's go outside for
        a walk!"

    <h2 translate>Use Consequences</h2>
    <p translate>
      Consequences help teach our children responsibility for what they do. They
      also allow discipline that is controlled. This is more effective than
      hitting or shouting
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li translate>
        Give your child a choice to follow your instruction before giving them
        the consequence.
      </li>
      <li translate>Try to stay calm when giving the consequence.</li>
      <li translate>
        Make sure you can follow through with the consequence. For example,
        taking away a teenager's phone for a week is hard to enforce. Taking it
        away for one hour is more realistic.
      </li>
      <li translate>
        Once the consequence is over, give your child a chance to do something
        good, and praise them for it.

    <h2 translate>Take a Pause</h2>
    <ul>
      <li translate>
        Feel like screaming? Give yourself a 10-second pause. Breathe in and out
        slowly five times. Then try to respond in a calmer way.
      </li>
      <li translate>Millions of parents say this helps - A LOT.</li>

    <h2 translate>Keep using Tips 1-3</h2>
    <ul>
      <li translate>
        One-on-One time, praise for being good, and consistent routines will
        reduce bad behaviour.
      </li>
      <li translate>
        Give your children and teens simple jobs with responsibilities. Just
        make sure it is something they are able to do. And praise them when they
        do it!
