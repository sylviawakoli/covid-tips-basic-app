      All children, including those with disabilities, need love, respect, nurturing, and time, especially during difficult and uncertain times.

    <h2>Keep your child safe.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It is strongly recommended that you follow local guidelines for COVID-19 while
        helping your child stay as active as possible both indoors and outdoors.</li>

    <h2>It is OK not to know the answers</h2>
    <p>
      It is fine to say "We don't know, but we are working on it; or we don't
      know, but we think." Use this as an opportunity to learn something new
      with your child!

    <h2>Heroes not bullies</h2>
    <p>
      Explain that Demo-1-19 has nothing to do with the way someone looks, where
      they are from, or what language they speak. Tell your child that we can be
      compassionate to people who are sick and those who are caring for them.
      Look for stories of people who are working to stop the outbreak and are
      caring for sick people.

    <h2>End on a good note</h2>
    <p>
      Check to see if your child is okay. Remind them that you care and that
      they can they can talk to you anytime. Then do something fun together!
