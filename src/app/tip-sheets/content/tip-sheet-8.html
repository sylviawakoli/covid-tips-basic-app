      We love our children and teenagers, but stress from caregiving, money, and COVID-19 can make us angry.
      Here is how we can maintain control and manage our anger so we do not hurt others.

        The same things usually make us get stressed and angry every time.

        What makes you angry? When does it happen? How do you normally react?
      </li>
      <li translate>
        Prevent anger from starting in the first place. Get some sleep or rest
        when you are tired. Try to eat something when you are hungry. Ask
        someone for support when you are feeling alone.
      </li>

        Look after yourself. Try the "Take a Pause" and "Managing Stress"
        resource sheets for ideas.

    <h2 translate>Take a break</h2>
    <ul>
      <li translate>
        When you start feeling angry, take a 20-second cool down. Breathe in and
        out slowly 5 times before you speak or move.
      </li>
      <li translate>
        Go somewhere else for 10 minutes to regain control of your emotions. If
        you have safe outdoor space, go outside.
      </li>
      <li translate>
        If you are getting angry because your baby won't stop crying, it's OK to
        leave them on their back in a safe location, like a crib, and walk away
        for a bit. Check on your baby every 5-10 minutes.

        We all need to connect. Talk to friends, family, and other support
        networks every day.

        Cut back on drinking or don't drink, especially when the kids are awake.

      <li translate>
        Do you have weapons or things that can be used to hurt others? Lock them
        up, hide them or take them out of the home.
      </li>
      <li translate>
        It's okay to have your children stay somewhere safe or take them to a
        place where they can get help.
