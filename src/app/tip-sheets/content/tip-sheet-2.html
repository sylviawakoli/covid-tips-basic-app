    <p translate style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">
      It‘s hard to feel positive when our kids or teenagers are driving us crazy. We often end up saying “Stop doing
      that!” But children are much more likely to do what we ask if we give them positive instructions and lots of
      praise for what they do right.

    <h2 translate>Say the behaviour you want to see</h2>

      <span translate>Use positive words when telling your child what to do; - like ‘Please put your clothes
        away’</span>
      <span translate>(instead of 'don't make a mess!')</span>

    <h2 translate>It’s all in the delivery</h2>
    <p translate>
      Shouting at your child will just make you and them more stressed and angrier. Get your child’s attention by using
      their name. Speak in a calm voice.

      Can your child actually do what you are asking them? It is very hard for a child to keep quiet inside for a whole
      day but maybe they can keep quiet for 15 minutes while you are on a call

    <h2 translate>Praise your child when they are behaving well</h2>
    <p translate>
      Try praising your child or teenager for something they have done well. They may not show it, but you’ll see them
      doing that good thing again. It will also reassure them that you notice and care.

    <h2 translate>Help your teen stay connected</h2>
    <p translate>
      Teens especially need to be able to communicate with their friends. Help your teen connect through social media
      and other safe distancing ways. This is something you can do together, too!
