    <span style="display: none" translate>Bad Behavior</span>
    <p translate style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">
      All children misbehave. It is normal when children are tired, hungry, afraid, or learning independence. And they
      can drive us crazy when stuck at home!

    <h2 translate>Try to redirect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li translate>
        Catch bad behavior early and redirect your kids' attention from a bad to a good behavior.
      </li>
      <li translate>
        Stop it before it starts! When they start to get restless, you can distract with something interesting or fun:
        "Come, let's go outside for a walk!"
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 translate>Use consequences</h2>
    <p translate>
      Consequences help teach our children responsibility for what they do. They also allow discipline that is
      controlled. This is more effective than hitting or shouting.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li translate>
        Give your child a choice to follow your instruction before giving them the consequence.
      </li>
      <li translate>Try to stay calm when giving the consequence.</li>
      <li translate>
        Make sure you can follow through with the consequence. For example, taking away a teenagerâ€™s phone for a week is
        hard to enforce. Taking it away for one hour is more realistic.
      </li>
      <li translate>
        Once the consequence is over, give your child a chance to do something good, and praise them for it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 translate>Take a Pause</h2>
    <ul>
      <li translate>
        Feel like screaming? Give yourself a 10-second pause. Breathe in and out slowly five times. Then try to respond
        in a calmer way.
      </li>
      <li translate>Millions of parents say this helps - A LOT.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 translate>Keep using Tips 1-3</h2>
    <ul>
      <li translate>
        One-on-One time, praise for being good, and consistent routines will reduce bad behaviour.
      </li>
      <li translate>
        Give your children and teens simple jobs with responsibilities. Just make sure it is something they are able to
        do. And praise them when they do it!
      </li>
