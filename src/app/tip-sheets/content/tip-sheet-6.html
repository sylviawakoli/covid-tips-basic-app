      Be willing to talk. They will already have heard something. Silence and
      secrets do not protect our children. Honesty and openness do. Think about
      how much they will understand. You know them best.

    <h2 translate>Be open and listen</h2>
    <p translate>
      Allow your child to talk freely. Ask them open questions and find out how
      much they already know.
    </p>
    <h2 translate>Be honest</h2>
    <p translate>
      Always answer their questions truthfully. Think about how old your child
      is and how much they can understand.
    </p>
    <h2 translate>Be supportive</h2>
    <p translate>
      Your child may be scared or confused. Give them space to share how they
      are feeling and let them know you are there for them.
    </p>

    <h2 translate>It is OK not to know the answers</h2>
    <p translate>
      It is fine to say "We don't know, but we are working on it; or we don't
      know, 'but we think'." Use this as an opportunity to learn something new
      with your child!
    </p>
    <h2 translate>Heroes not bullies</h2>
    <p translate>
      Explain that Demo-1-19 has nothing to do with the way someone looks, where
      they are from, or what language they speak. Tell your child that we can be
      compassionate to people who are sick and those who are caring for them.
      Look for stories of people who are working to stop the outbreak and are
      caring for sick people.
    </p>

  <div class="purple-bg">
    <h2 translate>End on a good note</h2>
    <p translate>
      Check to see if your child is okay. Remind them that you care and that
      they can they can talk to you anytime. Then do something fun together!
