    <ul>
      <li translate>
        Make a schedule for you and your children that has time for structured activities as well as free time. This can
        help children feel more secure and better behaved.

        Children or teenagers can help plan the routine for the day - like making a school timetable. Children will
        follow this better if they help to make it.
      </li>
      <li translate>
        Include exercise in each day - this helps with stress and kids with lots of energy at home.

      If you practice keeping safe distances and hygiene yourself, and treat others with compassion, especially those
      who are sick or vulnerable – your children and teenagers will learn from you.
