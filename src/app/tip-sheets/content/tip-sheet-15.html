      We spend a lot of time indoors with a young baby, and Covid-19 makes it
      much more intense. It is completely normal to feel isolated, overwhelmed,
      anxious, and scared for you and your baby.

        Be gentle with your children as they learn, but also with yourself as

      <p translate>
        Just because something didn’t go well today, or you lost your temper,
        this doesn’t define who you are as a parent. Remind yourself of the
        things you did well today, even if they may seem small.

          Keep calm and take a break! You can place your baby in a safe place on
          their back, and then walk away. Be sure to check on your baby every 5
          to 10 minutes.
