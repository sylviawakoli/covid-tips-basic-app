      <h2 translate>Types of play.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li translate>
          There are many different types of play that can be both fun AND educational.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Language, numbers, objects, drama, and music games give children opportunities to explore and express
          themselves in a safe and fun way.

      <h2 translate>Telling stories.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li translate>Tell your children a story from your own childhood.</li>
        <li translate>Ask your children to tell you a story.</li>
        <li translate>
          Make up a new story together starting with “Once upon a time…” Each person adds a new sentence to the story.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Act out a favorite story or movie – older children can even direct younger ones while learning responsibility.

      <h2 translate>Change the Object!</h2>
      <ul>
        <li translate>
          Every day household items like brooms, mops, or scarfs can become fun props for games.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Place an object in the center of the room and whenever someone has an idea, they jump in and show the rest
          what the object can be.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          For example, a broom might become a horse, microphone, or even a guitar!

      <h2 translate>Movement games</h2>
      <ul>
        <li translate>
          Create a dance choreography to your children’s favorite songs. First person does a dance move and everyone
          else copies. Everyone takes turns being the leader.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          “Challenge” who can do the most toe touches, jumping jacks, or laps around the room in a minute.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          “Mirror” each other’s facial expressions, movements, sounds. One person can start as the leader and then
          switch. Try it with no leaders!
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Freeze dance: Play music or someone sings a song, and everyone dances. When the music stops, everyone must
          freeze. Last person still dancing becomes the judge for the next round.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Animal dance: Same as above but when the music stops, call out a name of an animal, and everyone has to become
          that animal.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 translate>Memory game.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li translate>
          First person says, “When COVID-19 ends, I am going to… (e.g., go to the park)”.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Second person adds to first person, “When COVID-19 ends, I am going to the park and… (e.g., visit my best
          friend)”.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Each person adds to the previous trying to think of all of the fun things to do when COVID-19 ends.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          You can change this to any scenario in the future (e.g., when I see my friends).

      <h2 translate>Singing.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li translate>
          Singing songs to your baby or young child helps develop language.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Play or sing a song, and the first one to guess it right becomes the next leader.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Make up a song about handwashing or physical distancing. Add dance movements!
