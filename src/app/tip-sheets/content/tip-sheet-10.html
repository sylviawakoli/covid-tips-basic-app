      When we model peaceful and loving relationships, our children feel more
      secure and loved. Positive language, active listening, empathy help
      maintain a peaceful and happy family environment these stressful times.

          How we talk and behave in front of others is a big influence on how they
          behave too!
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Try to talk kindly to everyone in the family, adults and children.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Bad communication between adults in the household can have a negative
          impact on our children.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          The more we practise modelling peaceful, loving relationships for our
          children the more secure and loved they will feel.

          Looking after children and other family members is difficult, but it's
          much easier when responsibilities are shared.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Try to share households chores, childcare and other tasks equally
          amongst family members.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Create a schedule for time "on" and time "off" with other adults in your
          household.

          It is okay to ask for help when you are feeling tired or stressed so
          that you can take a break.

      <h2 translate>Feeling stressed or angry?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li translate>
          Give yourself a 10-second pause. Breathe in and out slowly five minutes.
          Then try to respond in a calmer way. Millions of parents say this helps
          -A LOT

          Call a truce when you can see arguments building up, and go into anther

      <h2 translate>Use positive language. It works!</h2>
      <ul>
        <li translate>
          Tell others what you want them to do instead of what you don't want them
          to do: instead of "Stop shouting," try "Please speak more quietly"
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Praise makes others feel appreciated and good bout themselves. Simple
          words like, "Thank you for clearing the dinner," or "Thank you for
          watching the baby" can make a big difference

          Be open and show them that you hear what they are saying
        </li>
        <li translate>
          It can help to even summarise what you have heard before responding:
          "What I hear you saying is..."
