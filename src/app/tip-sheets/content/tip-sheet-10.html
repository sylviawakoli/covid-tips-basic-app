      When we model peaceful and loving relationships, our children feel more
      secure and loved. Positive language, active listening, and empathy help
      maintain a peaceful and happy family environment under these stressful
      times.

          How we talk and behave in front of our children is a big influence on
          how they behave too!
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Try to talk kindly to everyone in the family, adults and children.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Bad communication between adults in the household can have a negative
          impact on our children.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          The more we practice modelling peaceful, loving relationships for our
          children the more secure and loved they will feel.

      <h2 translate>Share the load</h2>
      <ul>
        <li translate>
          Looking after children and other family members is difficult, but it's
          much easier when responsibilities are shared.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Try to share households chores, childcare and other tasks equally
          amongst family members.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Create a schedule for time "on" and time "off" with other adults in
          your household.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          It is okay to ask for help when you are feeling tired or stressed so
          that you can take a break.

      <h2 translate>Feeling stressed or angry?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li translate>
          Give yourself a 10-second pause. Breathe in and out slowly five times.
          Then try to respond in a calmer way. Millions of parents say this
          helps - A LOT.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Decide to take take a break from arguing when you see arguments
          building up, and go into another room or outside if you can.

      <h2 translate>Use positive language. It works!</h2>
      <ul>
        <li translate>
          Tell others what you want them to do instead of what you don't want
          them to do: instead of "Stop shouting," try "Please speak more
          quietly".
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Praise others to make them feel appreciated and good about themselves.
          Simple words like, "Thank you for clearing the dinner," or "Thank you
          for watching the baby" can make a big difference.

          Let each family member take turns to choose a whole-family activity
          each day.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Find ways to spend quality time with your partner and other adults in
          your home, too!

      <ul>
        <li translate>Listen to others when they are talking with you.</li>
        <li translate>
          Be open and show them that you hear what they are saying.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          It can help to even summarise what you have heard before responding:
          "What I hear you saying is..."
