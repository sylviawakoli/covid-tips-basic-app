      All children, including those with disabilities, need love, respect, nurturing, and time, especially during
      difficult and uncertain times.

        It is strongly recommended that you follow local guidelines for COVID-19 while helping your child stay as active
        as possible both indoors and outdoors
      </li>
      <li translate>
        Ask your local support team or intervention centres about special
        arrangements for COVID-19.
      </li>
      <li translate>
        Keep emergency contact numbers where you can easily see it, such as on

      <h2 translate>Be supportive, empathetic, and loving.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li translate>
          Your child may not have the same support they usually have, and this
          can lead to additional challenges such as increased stress, anxiety,
          and frustration.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Use physical and verbal support to make your child feel accepted and
          loved.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Positive body language, gestures, and words make a big difference!

        Get down to your child's level when communicating with your child.

      <li translate>Maintain eye contact, a positive attitude.</li>

    <h2 translate>Reinforce the positive!</h2>
    <ul>
      <li translate>
        Reinforce strengths with praise and stimulate their abilities rather
        than highlight the things they cannot do.
      </li>
      <li translate>
        Only help children when they need it. Too much support denies them the
        chance to become independent and can feel patronising.

        You are not alone! Keep connected with people who understand your
        situation. Share your challenges AND your successes.
      </li>
      <li translate>
        It is normal to feel stressed, frustrated, and afraid at this time.
      </li>
      <li translate>
        Be kind to yourself and take a break when you need to! Tip sheets "When
        We Get Angry" and "Keep Calm and Manage Stress" have some helpful
        advice.

      <h2 translate>Strengthen routines.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li translate>
          Routines help children feel secure and safe. See tip sheet, "Structure
          Up!" for more info
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Create a daily routine with activities that are familiar to your child
          and include some of their favourite activities.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Help your child connect to friends and family members via phone chats,
          writing cards, or drawing pictures.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Provide your child with choices so that they have a sense of control.
          This also increases self-esteem.
        </li>
        <li translate>
          Use simple language and clear instructions and nonverbal communication
          for children who need it (for example: gestures, pictures, and visual
          aids).
