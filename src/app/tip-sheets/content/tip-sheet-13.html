    more info</li>
    <li translate>iCreate a daily routine with activities that
      are familiar to your child and include
      some of their favourite activities.</li>
      <li translate> Help your child connect to friends
      and family members via phone chats,
      writing cards, or drawing pictures.</li>
      <li translate>Provide your child with choices so that
        they have a sense of control. This also
        increases self-esteem.</li>
        <li translate>Use simple language and clear
          instructions and nonverbal
          communication for children who
          need it (for example: gestures,
