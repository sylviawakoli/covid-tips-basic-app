      Millions are stressed about money because of COVID-19.It can make us feel
      exhausted, angry, and distracted. Children or teenagers asking for things
      can cause arguments. It can help them a lot when we involve them with
      family budgeting.

    <h2>Involve children and teens in making a family budget</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A budget is how we decide what we will spend our money on, even in
        stressful times.
      </li>
      <li>
        Making a budget together helps children understand that we all need to
        make hard decisions in difficult times.
      </li>
      <li>
        It also helps families to have enough at the end of the month,and borrow
        less.
