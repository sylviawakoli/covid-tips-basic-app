  "Keeping It Positive": "Cabanga okuhle ngaso sonke isikhathi",
  "It‘s hard to feel positive when our kids or teenagers are driving us crazy. We often end up saying “Stop doing that!” But children are much more likely to do what we ask if we give them positive instructions and lots of praise for what they do right.": "Kunzima ukucabanga kuhle nxa abantwana bekhathaza. Sivame ukucina sisithi 'Akeliyekele lokho'. Abantwana bavame ukwenza esifuna bekwenze nxa sibatshela esikufunayo ngendlela eqondileyo, lanxa sibabuka kumbe sibancoma",
  "Say the behaviour you want to see": "Caca ngendlela ofuna beziphathe ngayo",
  "Use positive words when telling your child what to do; - like ‘Please put your clothes away’": "Sebenzisa amazwi ayakhayo lakhuthazayo ekubatsheleni ofuna bekwenze njengokuthi 'Ngicela ukhuphe impahla zakho lapho'",
  "(instead of 'don't make a mess!')": "Hatshi ukuthi 'Ungangcolisi lapho",
  "It’s all in the delivery": "Kuya ngokuthi ukubeke njani",
  "Shouting at your child will just make you and them more stressed and angrier. Get your child’s attention by using their name. Speak in a calm voice.": "Ukutshingela umntwana kwenza lonke likhathazeke njalo lizonde. Umbize ngebizo lakhe nxa uxoxisana laye njalo uxoxe ngendlela ezithobileyo",
  "Get real": "Woba qotho / kuqakathekise",
  "Can your child actually do what you are asking them? It is very hard for a child to keep quiet inside for a whole day but maybe they can keep quiet for 15 minutes while you are on a call": "Umntwana uyenza lokho ofuna akwenze yini? Kunzima ukuthi umntwana atshone ethule endlini ilanga lonke, kodwa engathula okwemizuzo elitshumi lanhlamu, mhlawumbe usecingweni",
  "Praise your child when they are behaving well": "Umncome umntwana nxa eziphathe kuhle kumbe lapho ayabe enzekuhle khona",
  "Try praising your child or teenager for something they have done well. They may not show it, but you’ll see them doing that good thing again. It will also reassure them that you notice and care.": "Wenze uncoma abantwana lapho abayabe benze kuhle khona. Esikhathini abatshengiseli ukwemukela lokho kunconywa kodwa ngokuya kwesikhathi uyabona sebephindaphinda isenzo esiyabe sinconyiwe. Kubenza benanzelele ukuthi uyabanakekela",
  "Help your teen stay connected": "Phathisa abasakhulayo ukuthi bebebexoxisana labangane, njalo babekwazi okwenzakalayo",
  "Teens especially need to be able to communicate with their friends. Help your teen connect through social media and other safe distancing ways. This is something you can do together, too!": "Abasakhulayo bayakuqakathekisa ukuxoxisana labangane babo. Baphathise ukuxoxisana labanye ebulenjini (social media) langezinye indlela ezibenza bengasondelelani labanye. Lokhu lingakwenza lilonke"
